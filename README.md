# Foodtopia - Backend

**Foodtopia** is a platform which customers can use to have food be delivered to their home and a restaurant can use to find customers seamlessly. 

There are 6 types of users in our system: surfers, regular customers, VIP customers, delivery people, chefs, and managers. Surfers can browse menu items but are unable to do anything else until they register and their account is approved. Registered customers can order food, review delivery people, chefs, and food quality, and potentially become a VIP customer. In addition to all of the perks of being a customer, VIPs can order food at a 10% discount, their reviews/ratings count twice as much as that of a regular customer, and they have access to special dishes. Meanwhile, the application also provides managers with an interface from which they can manage virtually everything on the application.

The web application works as follows: a surfer registers to become a regular user with their personal information. Once the manager approves the user, the surfer becomes a regular user and is able to make orders. After a transaction is completed, the user can review the delivery person and chef. The delivery person can also review their customers. For a variety of reasons, managers can issue warnings and deregister regular customers or remove the VIP status of VIP customers.

Run the following to install the necessary dependencies

```
npm i
```

##### Setup env file

Create a `.env` file in your repository folder, paste the following and replace your username, and password with your credentials

## Repo Structure

All of the TypeScript code goes in `src` folder

##### Helper functions

Write any helper functions that can be reused in other places in `src/helpers` folder

##### MongoDB models

Write MongoDB models in `src/models` folder

##### REST Routes

In the `server.ts` file, import your routes from `src/routes` and structure the url as `/api/something`

Create a route file for each model that will conist of the REST methods.

- Write the middlewares for these routes in `src/routes/middlewares` folder.
  - Name a POST middleware as createModelName
  - Name a GET middleware as getModelName
  - Name a PUT/ PATCH middleware as updateModelName
  - Name a DELETE middleware as deleteModelName

## Available scripts

#### `npm run server`

Starts a nodemon server that watches changes to your TypeScript code and refresh the server without having to run node command after each change.

It should print `Server started on port 5000` and `MongoDB Connected` if everything ran correctly.

Run this script to make requests using Postman.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

#### `npm run start`
Runs production version of the code
